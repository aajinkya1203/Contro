# Contro
_Not your usual Web Assistant!_

A website which helps you in your daily life taking notes, helping you with reminders and Todos and even with a Leisure Section wherein you let your assistant do more of your search part! :wink:

>This is a project made by the students of [MPSTME, Mumbai](https://engineering.nmims.edu/) and is made entirely with React, Redux and Firebase. Look at the Credits part for more details on the developers!

## Status
